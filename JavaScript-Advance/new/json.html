      /*JSON stands for "JavaScript Object Notation." It's like a way for computers to talk to each other using simple text. Imagine it as a language computers understand to share information, like sending a message in a very organized and easy-to-read format. It's commonly used to exchange data between a web server and a web browser, or between different parts of a program. JSON uses key-value pairs and is pretty similar to how dictionaries work in real life, with words and their definitions. So, in simple terms, JSON is like a structured way for computers to share data.*/
